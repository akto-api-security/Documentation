# Undocumented endpoints

Undocumented APIs are APIs which are not properly documented and hence not part of the security testing process. Outdated documentation makes it difficult to find and/or fix vulnerabilities.

### Finding undocumented APIs:

Akto auto detects shadow endpoints ( endpoints which are undocumented but used). To find shadow endpoints, do the following:

1. Update your API documentation by going to the `documented` tab.
