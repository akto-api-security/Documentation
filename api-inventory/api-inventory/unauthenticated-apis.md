# Unauthenticated APIs 🔑

Unauthenticated APIs, specially the ones which are public facing are highly vulnerable to attacks. This is especially true for APIs that handle sensitive user or business information. This could be a big compliance issue for some companies.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Business impact:** Attackers can gain control to other users’ accounts in the system, read their personal data, and perform sensitive actions on their behalf, like money transactions and sending personal messages.
{% endhint %}

### **Review all unauthenticated endpoints**

<mark style="color:purple;">**Akto will auto detect if an API can be accessed without an auth token and will mark it unauthenticated.**</mark> Here is an example of how you can review unauthenticated endpoints in Akto:

1. Go to the open APIs tab. This will show you list of all the endpoints which are unauthenticated. 🔐&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Frame 46.png>)

&#x20; 2\. If an endpoint is intentionally unauthenticated, ignore it.&#x20;

&#x20; 3\. Click on the endpoint that shouldn't be unauthenticated. You will be taken to the endpoint  .  details page.

&#x20; 4\. Check its sample values in the values tab. Click on curl command.

5\. Test these these sample values in your terminal using curl command.

{% hint style="warning" %}
OWASP lists this as one of the top 10 API vulnerabilities [here](https://github.com/OWASP/API-Security/blob/master/2019/en/src/0xa2-broken-user-authentication.md)
