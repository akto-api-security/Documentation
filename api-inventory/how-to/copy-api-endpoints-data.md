# Copy API Endpoints Data

You can copy any API Endpoint in `curl` format or `Burp` format. You can now replay the API request by running `curl` in your terminal or using `Burp repeater`.  It helps to troubleshoot issues, debug problems, manage versions, and ensure that sensitive data is handled securely.

In the demonstration below, we have copied the request and response sample values of the **`api/quantity/`** endpoint which is located within the **`New Burp`** Collection.

Go to **API Discovery> API Collection**. Click on the **API Collection** and select the **API Endpoint** to copy the API Endpoint Data.

In the above demonstration, we have copied the response sample value of the **`api/quantity/`** endpoint within the **`New Burp`** Collection. This allows us to analyze the API behavior and use it for testing and validation within the Burp Suite.
