## Create a custom collection from another collection

Akto allows you to create a custom collection directly from other collections.

In the demonstration below, we have illustrated the steps to help you create a custom collection from another collection.

Go to **API Inventory > API Collection**. Go to any collection whose APIs you want to add in the collection and select those APIs. Then click on **Add to API Group** to open the selection dialog box. Choose any API group from there or create a new one as per your requirements.
