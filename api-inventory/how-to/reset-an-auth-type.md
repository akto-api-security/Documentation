# Reset an Auth Type

Akto automatically detects standard authentication methods JWT and Bearer authorization headers. However, you can also create your custom auth type and reset them accordingly. This is important for enhancing security and preventing unauthorized access to accounts or sensitive information.&#x20;

By periodically resetting authentication types, you can prevent unauthorized access and ensure that only authorized individuals or applications have access to their accounts or APIs.

### When to Reset

* To start fresh after multiple changes
* When experiencing unexpected authentication detection
* When adopting a new standardized auth approach

_**Note: Please mark the auth types you wish to reset as inactive, before resetting.**_

In the demonstration below, let's reset all the custom auth types.&#x20;

Go to **Settings>Auth types**. Click on the **Reset** button to reset the custom auth type.
