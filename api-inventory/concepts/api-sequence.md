# API Sequence

### Overview

API sequences are chains of API calls that represent user or system workflows. Identifying these sequences is critical for:

* Detecting logic-based vulnerabilities
* Improving testing coverage
* Understanding API usage patterns

Akto automatically detects API sequences based on traffic patterns and presents them with visual flow charts and associated statistics.

### ðŸ“Š API Sequence&#x20;

The **API Sequences Overview** section gives a snapshot of the identified sequences:

* **Total Sequences:** Number of detected unique API workflows
* **Total Transitions:** Number of API call transitions between steps
* **Avg Probability:** Likelihood of these sequences occurring in real traffic (based on behavioral analysis)

Example from your screenshot:

* **10 Total Sequences**
* **196 Total Transitions**
* **67.1% Avg Probability**

### ðŸ§  How Sequences Are Formed

Akto analyzes live traffic to group API endpoints into sequences by:

1. **Temporal Proximity** â€“ Requests made in close succession.
2. **Entity Linkage** â€“ Requests sharing IDs (like `orderId`, `userId`, `sessionId`).
3. **User Flow Logic** â€“ Common patterns like `login â†’ fetch profile â†’ create order`.

Each node in the sequence represents an endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/users/login`), and edges indicate transitions.
