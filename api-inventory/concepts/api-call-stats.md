This allows you to view recent activity spikes or analyze long-term patterns.

### Graph 1: API Call Count Over Time

**What it shows:**\
This time series chart displays the number of times the selected API endpoint was called during the chosen interval.

**How to use it:**

* Spot spikes or drops in usage that may indicate incidents or load changes.
* Identify peak usage periods and correlate with deployment, issues, or user activity.

### Graph 2: API Call Frequency Distribution

**What it shows:**\
This histogram visualizes how many users are making a specific number of API calls. It shows the distribution of call volume across users.

**How to use it:**

* Identify high-frequency users (potentially automated systems or abuse).
* Understand general usage patterns â€” whether most users are casual or intensive.
* Pinpoint outliers and investigate unusual behavior.
