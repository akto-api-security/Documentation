# Third Party APIs

In Akto's API inventory, these are clearly marked with the "Third-party" access type, helping you distinguish them from your internal APIs. This categorization is crucial for maintaining visibility over your application's external dependencies and ensuring proper security monitoring of all third-party integrations.
