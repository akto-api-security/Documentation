# Overview

Akto Test Editor is the test playground for security teams and developers to write their custom tests to find vulnerabilities in APIs.

Test Editor consists of three blocks:

1. [Test Library](test-library.md) consisting of 100+ built-in tests.
2. [YAML test](test-yaml.md) editor.
3. Sample [API](broken-reference) request and response to test.
