# Remediation Steps for API Protection Issues

Akto not only detects malicious behavior in real time through its API Protection engine, but also provides remediation guidance to help you reduce risk and improve your security posture immediately. These recommendations are directly accessible from the platform to support fast and informed action.

### What the Remediation Tab Includes

1. **Description of the threat:** Provides context on the observed behavior, such as injection attempts, data exfiltration, endpoint abuse, or authentication misuse.
2. **Example implementation:** In many cases, guidance includes example code or configuration templates to help you apply the fix.
3. **Built-in response options:** Actions such as blocking IP addresses or creating Jira tickets can be triggered directly from the interface.

### After Applying Remediation

1. Monitor the affected endpoint or IP for recurrence
2. Retest or revalidate the affected area if needed
3. Use integrated ticketing to track resolution
