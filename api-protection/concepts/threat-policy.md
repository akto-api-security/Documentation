#### Threat Policy

Threat policies are customizable filters that monitor and analyze your network traffic in real-time to detect and mitigate security threats. These policies help protect your applications by identifying and blocking malicious activities, such as attacks outlined in the OWASP Core Rule Set, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection. Additionally, you can configure policies to enforce geofencing or block traffic based on IP CIDR ranges.


To configure threat policies, navigate to the Threat Policy section under API Protection in left nav bar on your Akto Dashboard.
