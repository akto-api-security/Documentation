# Splunk

Akto supports integration with Splunk SIEM to help you streamline the process of detecting vulnerabilities, monitoring API traffic, and enhancing your web application security. This integration allows Akto to forward alert data directly to your Splunk instance for deeper analysis and correlation.

    ```
    https://splunk.yourdomain.com:8088
    ```

* **Audit logs**: User activity and critical changes.
* **Traffic insights**: HTTP logs tied to security incidents.

### ‚úÖ Verifying in Splunk

To verify incoming data:

1. Go to **Search & Reporting** in your Splunk dashboard.
2.  Use a search like:

    ```
    index=your_index_name sourcetype=_json source="Akto"
    ```
3. Look for recent logs from Akto to confirm successful integration.

***

### üõ† Troubleshooting

* Ensure your Splunk HEC is reachable over the network.
* Confirm the token is valid and has the correct permissions.
* Verify port (default: 8088) is open.
* Use `tcpdump` or `curl` to test connectivity if needed.
