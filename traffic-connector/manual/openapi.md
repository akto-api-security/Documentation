# Connect Akto with OpenAPI

## Introduction

[Akto](https://www.akto.io/) needs your staging, production or other environment's traffic to Discover APIs and analyze for AP misconfiguration. It does so by connecting to one of your [traffic sources](../traffic-data-sources.md). If you don't have access to staging or production environment, you can create API inventory using OpenAPI spec.

Note that traffic from OpenAPI spec won't be automated like the native cloud connectors.
{% endhint %}

### Pre-requisites for Akto OpenAPI connection

* You must have an `active Akto account`. If you don't have one, sign up for an account on the Akto platform.
  * [Cloud Signup](https://app.akto.io/)
* Prepare the OpenAPI specification you wish to upload to Akto. Make sure these collections are organized and contain the API requests you want to work with. You can also add your authentication mechanism in the specification file itself, to unlock advanced capabilities of the AKTO testing module.
