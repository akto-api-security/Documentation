# MCP Collection

Akto automatically groups MCP tools, resources, and prompts into meaningful collections based on their server names. You can sort and create your own custom MCP collections as needed.

For example, if you want all your payment-related MCP tools to be part of a separate collection, you can create a new collection named "Payment MCP Tools" and add all tools that handle payment operations to this newly created collection.

You can also [set environment type](../../how-to/set-environment-type.md) for an MCP collection as **Staging** or **Production**.

## View MCP Collection

To view details of an MCP collection:

1. Go to **Agentic Discovery > MCP Collections**
2. Click on any **MCP Collection** to view its components (tools, resources, and prompts)

You can see all components in the collection. Click on any component to view more details about it.

## Sort MCP Collections

To sort MCP collections by parameters like component count:

1. Go to **Agentic Discovery > MCP Collections**
2. Click on the **Sort** icon to sort the collections
3. Select parameters like **"More"** and **"Components"** to order collections by the number of components they contain
