# Akto's Agentic Security

Akto provides comprehensive security for AI agents, LLM applications, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementations. As organizations deploy increasingly autonomous AI systems, Akto ensures these agent components remain secure, compliant, and resilient against emerging threats.

## What is Agentic Security?

Agentic security focuses on protecting AI agents, their tool integrations, and MCP endpoints from vulnerabilities specific to autonomous systems. Unlike traditional API security, agentic security addresses:

* **Prompt injection attacks** that manipulate agent behavior
* **Tool permission escalation** where agents access unauthorized capabilities
* **MCP vulnerabilities** in Model Context Protocol implementations
* **Data leakage** through agent interactions and tool calls
* **Supply chain risks** in agent dependencies and third-party integrations

## Platform Overview

### Agentic Discovery

Automatically map your entire agent landscape, including AI agents, LLM components, MCP endpoints, and tool integrations. Track agent behaviors, data flows, and identify shadow or zombie agents across your infrastructure.

### Agentic Red Teaming

Test your agents with 1000+ specialized security probes designed for agentic systems. Identify vulnerabilities through automated testing that simulates real-world attack patterns including prompt injections, tool abuse, and privilege escalation.

### Guardrails

Deploy real-time protection for your production agents. Monitor and block threats as they occur, enforce schema conformance, manage threat actors, and prevent successful exploits before they impact your systems.

### Probe Library

Access and customize an extensive library of security tests specifically designed for agent components. Create custom probes using YAML templates to address your unique security requirements.

### Issues Management

Centralize vulnerability tracking across all agent components. Triage security issues, integrate with Jira and Azure DevOps, export vulnerability reports, and maintain consistent issue tracking across multiple scans.

### Compliance

Ensure your agentic systems meet regulatory requirements. Map detected issues to compliance frameworks including SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI DSS, GDPR, and more. Generate audit-ready reports demonstrating compliance posture.

### Agentic Security Posture

Gain comprehensive visibility into your agent security landscape. Track risk scores, identify misconfigurations, detect sensitive data exposure, and monitor test coverage across all agent components.

## Getting Started

1. **Deploy Akto** - Choose between [Akto Cloud](broken-reference) or [Self-Hosted](broken-reference)
