# Quick start with Akto Self Hosted

## Introduction

If you're like us, you probably have a lot of data that is only accessible from your private network (locally or behind your [VPN](https://cybernews.com/what-is-vpn/#how-does-a-vpn-work)). That's why we built the self-hosted version of Akto.

### How to deploy?

Deploy Akto locally or on your own cloud. Choose any of the below options to get started:

1. [AWS deploy](aws-deploy.md)
2. [GCP Deploy](gcp-deploy.md)
3. [Local Deploy](local-deploy.md)
