# Connect Akto with eBPF

## Introduction

Connecting with Akto's eBPF traffic collector is recommended for mTLS systems.

For a better understanding, here's an architecture diagram of the setup.

## Adding Akto traffic collector

1. Setup Akto data processor using the guide [here](../../../hybrid-saas.md)
2. Apply the Daemonset configuration given below using `kubectl apply -f akto-daemonset-config.yaml -n <NAMESPACE>`. You will find `AKTO_NLB_IP` after setting up Akto data processor, as mentioned above.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: akto-k8s
  namespace: {NAMESPACE}
  labels:
    app: akto-collector
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: akto-collector
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: akto-collector
    spec:
      hostNetwork: true
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirstWithHostNet
      hostPID: true
      containers:
      - name: mirror-api-logging
        image: aktosecurity/mirror-api-logging:k8s_ebpf
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 1Gi
          requests:
            cpu: 50m
            memory: 50Mi
        env: 
          - name: AKTO_TRAFFIC_BATCH_TIME_SECS
            value: "10"
          - name: AKTO_TRAFFIC_BATCH_SIZE
            value: "100"
          - name: AKTO_KAFKA_BROKER_MAL
            value: "<AKTO_NLB_IP>:9092"
        securityContext:
          capabilities:
            add:
            - SYS_PTRACE
            - SYS_ADMIN
          privileged: true
        volumeMounts:
          # needed to load kernel headers
          - name: lib-modules
            mountPath: /lib/modules
            readOnly: true
          # needed to trace kernel events
          - name: sys-kernel
            mountPath: /sys/kernel
            readOnly: true
          - name: host
            mountPath: /host
            readOnly: true
      volumes:
        - name: sys-kernel
          hostPath:
            path: /sys/kernel
        - name: lib-modules
          hostPath:
            path: /lib/modules
        - name: host
          hostPath:
            path : /
```

3. For example, if you've deployed `akto-mini-runtime` using akto's helm charts in `akto` namespace, the `AKTO_NLB_IP` would be `akto-mini-runtime-mini-runtime.akto.svc.cluster.local` .
4. You can add and configure the env variables below to control the daemonset. Here's a diagram of how the module processes traffic:

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/ebpf-diagram.png" alt="Traffic processing"><figcaption><p>eBPF Traffic Processing</p></figcaption></figure>

```yaml
# This helps in filtering traffic sent to akto, based on certain headers. Here is an example for sending traffic only for 'bookinfo' namespace in an istio setup.
- name: AKTO_MODULE_DISCOVERY_CONFIG
  value: '[{"key":{"eq":"x-forwarded-client-cert","ifAbsent":"reject"},"value":{"regex":".*bookinfo.*"}}]'
# Time limit ( in seconds ) after which, a traffic stream is processed and marked inactive. The same stream, is not processed again.
- name: TRAFFIC_INACTIVITY_THRESHOLD
  value: "3"
# Max traffic connections kept in memory 
- name: TRAFFIC_MAX_ACTIVE_CONN
  value: "4096"
# Make this flag true to disable egress traffic. It is recommended to keep this false.
- name: TRAFFIC_DISABLE_EGRESS
  value: "false"
# Max mem usage after which the pod restarts ( in MB )
- name: AKTO_MEM_THRESH_RESTART
  value: "500"
# Max limit of traffic buffer kept in memory ( in MB )
- name: TRAFFIC_BUFFER_THRESHOLD
  value: "400"
# Ignore traffic coming from unresolved IPs, i.e. requests with host header of the format <a.b.c.d>
- name: AKTO_IGNORE_IP_TRAFFIC
  value: "false"
# Ignore traffic coming from AWS cloud metadata IP
- name: AKTO_IGNORE_CLOUD_METADATA_CALLS
  value: "false"
# If you only want to trace traffic for which SSL termination happens at proxy/service.
- name: CAPTURE_ALL
  value: "true"
```

5. You can check your `agentic inventory` on Akto dashboard to see agentic components being discovered.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**The traffic will contain a lot of sensitive data - does it leave my VPC?**

Data remains strictly within your VPC. Akto doesn't take data out of your VPC at all.

**Does adding DaemonSet have any impact on performance or latency?**

Zero impact on latency. The DaemonSet doesn't sit like a proxy. It works on eBPF technology, which works on traces function calls at kernel level. It is very lightweight. We have benchmarked it against traffic as high as 20M agent requests/min. It consumes very low resources (CPU & RAM).

**How can I control logs generated by akto's eBPF traffic collector ?**

You can utilize the `AKTO_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable, which accepts `DBEUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `OFF` as log levels.\
Default level is set to `WARN`.

**I don't see my error on this list here.**
