## Step 2: Add API data

To analyze and secure your APIs, Akto needs to access your API traffic. You can add this using any of our supported traffic connectors.

1. In the dashboard, look for the `Quick start`

## Step 3: Run test

Once you've added your API traffic, you can start running security tests:

1. In the dashboard, click on the "Run Test" button and a modal will pop up, allowing you to select the Tests categories and type of tests you want to test on your collection.
2. Once you select the above, click the "Run once now" button in the modal.
