## Agentic Discovery

Automatically discover and inventory all your AI agents, MCP servers, and tools across your infrastructure.

* [Homegrown Discovery Agents](getting-started/agentic-discovery/homegrown-discovery-agents/) - API Gateways, eBPF, Kubernetes, manual import, and MCP Recon
* [Endpoints Discovery Agents](getting-started/agentic-discovery/endpoints-discovery-agents/) - Browser extensions, secure web networks, MCP endpoint shield, and agentic shield

***

## Agentic Red Teaming

Test your AI agents and MCP servers with 1000+ specialized security probes. Identify vulnerabilities like prompt injections, tool abuse, and privilege escalation before attackers do.

Import your components to start testing:

* [AI Agents](getting-started/agentic-red-teaming/ai-agent-import.md) - AWS Bedrock, Azure AI, Databricks, Vertex AI, Watsonx, or custom agents
* [MCP Servers](getting-started/agentic-red-teaming/mcp-import.md) - Model Context Protocol tools, resources, and prompts
* [AI Models](getting-started/agentic-red-teaming/ai-model-import.md) - Large language models and custom AI implementations

***

## Agentic Guardrails

Deploy real-time protection for your production agents. Block threats as they occur, enforce schema conformance, and prevent exploits before they impact your systems.

Set up protection proxies:

* [MCP Proxy](getting-started/agentic-guardrails/akto-mcp-proxy.md) - Real-time protection for MCP servers
* [Agent Proxy](getting-started/agentic-guardrails/akto-agent-proxy.md) - Real-time protection for AI agents
