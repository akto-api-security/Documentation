# What is Akto?

Applications are only as fast and secure as the APIs that power them. Today, fast pace of application development makes it very hard for security teams to ensure security coverage of APIs.&#x20;

**Akto enables security and engineering teams to secure their APIs by doing three things:**

1. [API inventory](broken-reference)
2. [Run business logic tests in CI/CD](broken-reference)
3. [Find vulnerabilities in run-time](api-inventory/sensitive-data.md)
