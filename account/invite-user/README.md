### Inviting a New Team Member

1. On the Users page, click the "Invite user" button in the top right corner.
2. A dialog box titled "Add team member" will appear.
3. Enter the new member's details:
   * Account email: Input the email address of the person you're inviting.
   * Role: Select the appropriate role from the dropdown menu (e.g., Security Engineer, Developer, Guest).
4. After entering the details, click "Invite" or a similar confirmation button.

### Sharing the Invitation

After confirming the invitation, you'll see an "Invite link" dialog:

1. You'll be presented with a unique invitation link.
2. You can either:
   * Copy the link directly by clicking the "Copy invitation" button.
   * Or, share the displayed link manually with your invitee.
3. The invitee can use this link to create their account and join your Akto workspace.

### Managing Invitations

* Pending invitations will be displayed in the user list with a status like "Invitation sent for security engineer".
* You can resend or cancel pending invitations if needed.

### Post-Invitation

* Once the invitee accepts the invitation and creates an account, they will appear in your team members list with their assigned role.
* You can modify a team member's role after they've joined by using the role dropdown next to their name.

Remember, different roles have different permissions within Akto. Ensure you assign the appropriate role based on the team member's responsibilities and required access level. Learn more [Role permissions](../understanding-role-permissions.md).
