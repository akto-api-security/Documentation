#### **1. Change the Role Settings**

1. Go to your **Settings > Roles.**
2. Find and click the role you want to update (e.g., **JUICE\_SHOP\_APIS**).
3. Search and select the list of API Collections you want to include in the role.

#### **2. Assign a Permission Level (Optional)**

1. Use the dropdown next to **Guest** (or the default permission) to choose the appropriate permission level.
2. This controls what actions role members can perform on the selected collections.&#x20;

#### **3. (Optional) Set as Default Invite Role**

* If you want any new users invited under this role to automatically have these permissions, check the **Default invite role** option.

***

#### **Best Practices & Tips**

* **Review Permissions**: Before finalizing, confirm that the permission level is correct for each collection to avoid granting excessive access.
* **Name Roles Clearly**: If you manage multiple roles, use a clear naming convention (e.g., **API-Only**, **View-Only**, etc.) to distinguish them easily.
* **Default Role**: Be cautious when setting a default invite role—any newly invited user will automatically inherit those permissions.

This new feature streamlines role management by allowing you to pick exactly which collections each role can access.&#x20;
