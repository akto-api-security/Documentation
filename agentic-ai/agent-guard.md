# Agent Guard

## 📖 Introduction

Akto's Agent Guard provides a comprehensive security layer for AI-powered applications through intelligent scanners that detect and prevent threats in real-time. This reference guide covers all scanners available in the Agent Guard system.

### 🤔 What are Guardrail Scanners?

Guardrail scanners are specialized security modules that analyze content flowing through your AI systems. They act as intelligent checkpoints 🔍, examining both user inputs and AI-generated outputs to identify security threats, policy violations, data leaks, and content safety issues before they cause harm.

### ⚙️ How Guardrails Work

Akto's Agent Guard operates on a dual-layer approach:

- **📥 Input Layer**: Scanners validate user messages before they reach your AI models, blocking malicious prompts, credential leaks, and policy violations
- **📤 Output Layer**: Scanners verify AI-generated responses before delivery to users, preventing data exposure, harmful content, and compliance violations

Each scanner specializes in detecting specific threat categories, from credential exposure and prompt injection attacks to toxic content and sensitive data leaks. Scanners can be combined to create custom security policies tailored to your application's needs.

### 🎯 When to Use Which Scanners

**🤖 For Agentic Applications**:
- Use input scanners to protect your AI endpoints from malicious prompts
- Use output scanners to prevent your AI from exposing API vulnerabilities or credentials

**👥 For Customer-Facing Applications**:
- Deploy content safety scanners (Toxicity, Bias, BanTopics) to maintain appropriate communication
- Enable PII detection scanners (Sensitive, Secrets) to ensure privacy compliance

**🏢 For Enterprise AI Systems**:
- Implement comprehensive scanner suites covering security, compliance, and content policies
- Layer multiple scanners for defense-in-depth protection

### 📋 Scanner Categories

This guide organizes scanners into two main categories:

- **📥 Input/Prompt Scanners**: Protect against threats in user messages
- **📤 Output Scanners**: Ensure safety and compliance in AI responses

Each scanner entry includes its purpose, detection capabilities, risk prevention benefits, real-world use cases, and example detections.
