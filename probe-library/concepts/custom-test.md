# Custom Probes

Security requirements for agentic systems are often unique to your business context and agent architecture. Akto enables you to write and automate custom security probes tailored to your specific AI agents and MCP implementations.

You can write probes in YAML to test various aspects of your agent components, including prompt handling, tool permission boundaries, data leakage patterns, MCP endpoint security, and agentic-specific vulnerabilities. Custom probes are especially useful for testing unique agent behaviors, complex tool chains, or proprietary LLM integrations that may not be covered by predefined probes.

The Probe Library in Akto includes over 1000 built-in probes for agentic security, a YAML-based editor for creating custom probes, and features to test probes on sample agent components. This streamlines the security testing process for autonomous systems.

For more information on creating custom tests, please refer to this documentation- [Create a Custom Test](../how-to/create-a-custom-test.md).
