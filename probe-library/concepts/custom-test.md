# Custom Test

There will always be a lot of security test cases that are very specific to your business and won't be available in a generic testing tool. You can write and automate such tests in Akto.

You can write tests in YAML to check various aspects of your APIs, such as behavior, response times, error handling, and security vulnerabilities. Custom tests are especially useful when dealing with unique scenarios or complex systems that may not be covered by predefined tests.

The Test Editor in Akto includes a test library with over 200 built-in tests, a YAML-based editor for creating custom tests, and a feature to run tests on a sample API. This streamlines the testing process and makes writing and running effective tests for your APIs easier for you.

For more information on creating custom tests, please refer to this documentation- [Create a Custom Test](../how-to/create-a-custom-test.md).
