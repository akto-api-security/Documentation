# Overview

Akto Probe Library is the security testing framework for teams protecting AI agents, LLM components, and MCP endpoints. Write custom probes to discover vulnerabilities specific to autonomous systems including prompt injections, tool abuse, and permission escalation.

Probe Library consists of three blocks:

1. [Test Library](test-library.md) with 1000+ built-in probes for agentic security
2. [YAML probe](test-yaml.md) editor for custom test creation
3. Sample agent component requests and responses for testing
