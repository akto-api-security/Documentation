# Deactivate Test

Akto provides you with a feature to deactivate the custom test. It ensures that users don't encounter any inaccurate or obsolete results, thereby maintaining the integrity of the security testing process.&#x20;

Additionally, deactivation facilitates maintenance and updates by preventing false results or errors during system updates or modifications.&#x20;

In the demonstration below, we have deactivated the test named **“Broken Authentication by removing the auth token.”**

Go to the **Test Editor.** Select a **Custom test** from the **Custom Test Collection** that you want to deactivate. Click on the **“x”** button to inactive the test.
