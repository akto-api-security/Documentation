# Edit Test

If you want to make small changes in Akto Test Library, you can use Akto's test editor.&#x20;

Customization of tests assists in improving security coverage, adaptability to change, and incorporation of business knowledge.

In the demonstration below, let’s edit an Akto test by selecting a pre-existing test named **“Broken Authentication by removing auth token”** under the test category **“Broken User Authentication (BUA).”**

Go to **Test Editor** to edit Akto's test. Choose **test collection > pre-existing test**. Customize the **YAML file** based on your requirements, then click on **Save** to save the custom test.

In the demonstration above, we have selected a pre-existing test named **“Broken Authentication by removing auth token”** under the test category **“Broken User Authentication (BUA)”** and customized the YAML file by changing **“api\_selection\_filters”** for **“response\_code”** between 500 and 700. It will create a new test in the list.
