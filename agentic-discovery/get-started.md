# Get Started

Discover and inventory all your AI agents, MCP servers, and tool integrations across your infrastructure. Akto automatically maps your agentic landscape, helping you identify shadow agents, track agent behaviors, and maintain visibility over your autonomous systems.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Sign Up or Log In

1. Go to [app.akto.io](https://app.akto.io)
2. Sign up for a new account or log in to your existing account

### Step 2: Choose Your Discovery Method

Navigate to **Quick Start** in your Akto dashboard and select your preferred discovery method:

[**Homegrown Discovery Agents**](../akto-argus-agentic-ai-security-for-homegrown-ai/connectors/) Deploy discovery agents to continuously monitor your infrastructure. Includes API Gateways, eBPF, Kubernetes, manual import, and MCP Recon.

[**Endpoints Discovery Agents**](../akto-atlas-agentic-ai-security-for-employee-endpoints/endpoints-discovery-agents/) Get started immediately without infrastructure setup. Includes browser extensions, secure web networks, MCP endpoint shield, and agentic shield.

### Step 3: Configure Your Discovery Agent

Follow the setup guide for your chosen method. Each connector provides step-by-step instructions for deployment.

### Step 4: View Your Inventory

Once your discovery agent is running:

1. Go to **Agentic Discovery** in your dashboard
2. See all discovered agents, MCP servers, and tools
3. Click on any component to view detailed information

## What Gets Discovered

Akto automatically identifies:

* AI agents and their endpoints
* MCP servers (tools, resources, prompts)
* Tool integrations and permissions
* Data flows and agent interactions
* Authentication patterns

## Next Steps

* Run [security tests](../akto-argus-agentic-ai-security-for-homegrown-ai/agentic-red-teaming/get-started/) on discovered components
* Enable [Guardrails](../agentic-guardrails/overview/) for real-time protection
* Review discovered agents for shadow or zombie components
