3. Start browsing your AI applications

The extension will automatically capture and send agent traffic to your Akto dashboard for discovery and security analysis.

## What Gets Captured

The Chrome extension monitors:
- AI agent API calls and responses
- MCP server interactions
- Tool invocations and parameters
- Authentication tokens and headers
- Request/response payloads

All captured data is sent securely to your Akto instance for analysis.

## Requirements

- Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, or other Chromium-based browser
- Active Akto account or self-hosted instance
- Network access to your Akto dashboard

## Privacy & Security

The extension only captures traffic when actively enabled and only sends data to your configured Akto instance. You have full control over what gets monitored.
