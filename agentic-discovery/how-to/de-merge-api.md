# De-merge Agentic Component

Akto automatically merges agent components when it detects changing elements like UUIDs, String, Integer, etc in component endpoints. This helps keep your agentic inventory clean and organized. However, there might be cases where you want to separate these merged components.

### Steps to De-merge Components:

1. Go to Agentic Collection page from left nav
2. Open your Agentic Collection
3. Select the agent component endpoint you want to de-merge
4. Click on more options and then click on `De merge` button

### This action will:

* Split the merged component endpoint back into separate component endpoints
* Restore individual tracking for each component endpoint
* Maintain all existing probe coverage and security checks
* Keep your agentic inventory accurate while giving you more granular control
