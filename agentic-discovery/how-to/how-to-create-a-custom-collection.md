# Create a custom collection

## Create a custom collection from scratch

Akto allows you to create a custom collection from scratch using APIs from other collections.

In the demonstration below, we have illustrated the steps to help you create a custom collection from scratch.

Go to **API Discovery > API Collection**. Click on **Create new collection** to open then dialog and click on **Add endpoints**. Then you can add endpoints using different conditions as per your requirement and click on **Create** to save the collection.

## Create a custom collection from another collection

Akto allows you to create a custom collection directly from other collections.

In the demonstration below, we have illustrated the steps to help you create a custom collection from another collection.

Go to **API Discovery > API Collection**. Go to any collection whose APIs you want to add in the collection and select those APIs. Then click on **Add to API Group** to open the selection dialog box. Choose any API group from there or create a new one as per your requirements.

**NOTE:** Adding APIs to a custom collection creates a reference to the original APIs in the custom collection. It does not duplicate them. Thus any changes to the original APIs are automatically reflected in the custom collections.
