# View New API Endpoint

Akto automatically updates your API inventory whenever new APIs are detected and allows you to view the new API endpoints. By viewing new endpoints, you get a detailed overview of the new API's capabilities.&#x20;

This includes details of header & response data and payloads, which show how data is structured when interacting with the API. You can also identify any sensitive parameters that the endpoint has, such as passwords or personal identification numbers, ensuring that they are handled securely.

In the demonstration below, we will view all the new API endpoints populated in your API collections over the last two months.
