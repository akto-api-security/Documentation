# Delete an API Collection

Akto allows you to delete your API collections when needed. You can delete your API collection for reasons such as removing outdated collections or cleaning up after the testing and development phases.

If you no longer need an API collection or wish to remove it, you can delete the collection. Akto will then remove all associated endpoints, the same will no longer be available in the API collection list.

In the demonstration below, letâ€™s delete the **`"Postman API Documentation #reference"`** API collection from our API collections list.

Go to the **API Discovery > API Collection**. Check the API collection that you want to delete and click on the **Remove Collections** button.
