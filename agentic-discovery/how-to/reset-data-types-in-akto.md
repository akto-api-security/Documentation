# Reset Data Types in Akto

### Overview

Akto allows you to reset data types when you need to revert changes made to custom data types or refresh data type detection settings. Both built-in data types (like EMAIL, JWT, ADDRESS) and custom data types (like TXN\_ID) can be reset to their original state. This can be particularly useful when troubleshooting data detection issues or when you need to start fresh with your data type configurations.

### Steps to Reset Data Types

1. Log into Akto Dashboard
2. Navigate to API Discovery > Sensitive Data
3. Select Datatype you want to reset
4. Click the Reset button
