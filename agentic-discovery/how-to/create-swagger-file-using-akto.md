# Export Component Specifications Using Akto

Akto allows you to export agent collections and MCP collections in various formats that hold vital information about components, request and response formats, parameters, data models, authentication methods, and other essential details.

Once Akto captures all agent components and MCP endpoints, you can export collections for documentation purposes.

Go to **Agentic Discovery > Collections.** Select the collection you want to export. Click on **Export** to generate the specification file.

This file can be used for various purposes such as documentation generation, integration with other tools, and sharing component specifications with team members or third-party developers.
