# Create Swagger File Using Akto

Akto allows you to generate an Open API Schema in a JSON format that holds vital information about the API's endpoints, request and response formats, parameters, data models, authentication methods, and other essential details.

Once Akto captures all the APIs, you can export the entire list of APIs or collections in the form of a Swagger file. This gives you fully automated API documentation for your APIs.

In the demonstration below, we generated a Swagger file for the **`juice_shop_demo`** API collection.

Go to **API Discovery > API Collection.** Select the **API Collection** you want to create a swagger file. Click on **Export > OpenAPI spec** to generate the swagger file.

In the above demonstration, we exported the **juice\_shop\_demo** API collection into a Swagger file format (OpenAPI Specification) and saved it in the local storage. This Swagger file contains crucial details about the API's endpoints, request and response formats, parameters, data models, and authentication methods.&#x20;

This file can be used later on for various purposes such as documentation generation, API testing, integration with other tools, and sharing API specifications with team members or third-party developers.
