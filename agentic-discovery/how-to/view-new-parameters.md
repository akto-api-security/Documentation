# View New Parameters

Akto automatically updates API inventory, whenever a new endpoint has been added to your API collection and also updates the parameters it contains. If there is any sensitive parameter has been contained by any new endpoint, Akto automatically updates it in API changes. You can view new parameters and new sensitive parameters like **`Passwords`** or **`Email ID`** that you need to keep safe. So with Akto, you always know what's going on with your APIs and can stay safe from unwanted surprises.

In the demonstration below, letâ€™s view all the newly added parameters over the last two months.
