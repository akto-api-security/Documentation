# Agent Components

## What is an Agent Component?

Agent Components are specific interaction points within an AI Agent that serve as access points for different functionalities or capabilities. They define where and how data or actions can be requested or performed within the AI Agent system, enabling communication between users, systems, and the agent's core functionality.
