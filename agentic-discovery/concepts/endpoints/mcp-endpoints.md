# MCP Components

## What is an MCP Component?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) components are specific interaction points within the Model Context Protocol that serve as access points for different functionalities, tools, resources, and prompts. They define where and how data or actions can be requested or performed within the MCP system, enabling standardized communication between AI models and external services.

## View an MCP Component

Akto automatically updates your MCP inventory whenever new MCP components are detected and allows you to view them in detail. By viewing MCP components, you get a detailed overview of the protocol's capabilities and exposed functionalities.

### What You Can View

When viewing an MCP component, you have access to:

- **Request & Response Data**: Shows how data is structured when interacting with the MCP server
- **Message Payloads**: Detailed view of the protocol communication format
- **Sensitive Parameters**: Identification of security-sensitive data such as authentication tokens or private information
- **Sample Values**: Real examples showing how data flows during MCP protocol communications

### How to View MCP Components

1. Navigate to **Agentic Discovery > MCP Collection**
2. Select your collection
3. Click on an MCP Component to view its details

The request and response structure provides a deep understanding of the interaction between the MCP client and server, allowing you to analyze how data flows during protocol communications.
