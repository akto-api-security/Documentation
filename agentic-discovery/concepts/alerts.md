# Alerts

Configuring alerts in Akto can help you stay informed about the latest developments in your API infrastructure. For example, you can set up alerts to notify you when Akto detects a new sensitive endpoint or when an existing API begins sharing sensitive data.

You can also configure alerts based on the latest test results, so you can get daily updates on how many new security issues Akto has detected. Furthermore, if Akto stops receiving data for a particular service, you will be notified immediately.

For more information on how to set up alerts in Akto, please refer to this documentation - [Configure alerts on API changes](../how-to/configure-alerts-on-api-changes.md).
