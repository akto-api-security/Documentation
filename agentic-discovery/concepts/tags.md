# Tags

## Tags in Akto

Tags in Akto are flexible labels used to categorize and organize your agent components and MCP endpoints. They help in filtering, searching, and managing large agentic inventories more efficiently.

## What are Tags?

Tags are custom labels you can apply to:
- Agent components
- MCP servers and their tools
- Agent collections
- MCP collections

Unlike built-in classifications (like Environment Type or Access Type), tags are completely customizable to fit your organization's needs.

## Tag Management

### Tag List View

The tags interface shows:
- All created tags and their usage count
- Tag name, creation date, and creator
- Number of components using each tag
- Search and pagination capabilities

## Use Cases

### Security Testing
Tag agents for targeted security testing:
```
- #prompt-injection-tested
- #red-team-approved
- #security-review-pending
```

### Compliance Tracking
Tag components by regulatory requirements:
```
- #gdpr-compliant
- #hipaa-required
- #pci-dss-scope
```

### Performance Monitoring
Tag for operational tracking:
```
- #high-token-usage
- #slow-response
- #needs-optimization
```

### Incident Response
Tag for security incidents:
```
- #incident-2024-01
- #vulnerability-found
- #remediation-required
```

Tags are a powerful and flexible tool for organizing your agentic inventory according to your organization's unique needs.
