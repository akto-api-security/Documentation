# MCP Security

## MCP Security

The Akto MCP Security Module is designed for teams working with LLMs, agent frameworks, or AI-based orchestration systems. As MCPs become a new layer in modern application stacks, they also introduce new attack surfaces — often unmonitored and untested. Akto brings complete visibility and protection with zero friction.

Akto automatically identifies MCP servers, discovers associated API endpoints, runs targeted security tests, and continuously monitors for misconfigurations, threats, and data leaks — all in real time.

#### 🔧 Key Capabilities

1. **MCP Server Discovery**

Gain instant visibility into every MCP server running in your environment:

* Automatically detects MCP servers and the APIs they expose.
* Works across cloud, hybrid, and on-prem environments.

2. **Security Testing for MCPs**

Uncover critical vulnerabilities unique to MCP architectures using Akto's curated test library:

* **Prompt Injection**
* **Tool Poisoning**
* **Excessive Permissions**
* **Unauthorized Endpoint Access**
* **Insecure Authentication**

Each test simulates real-world attack paths and highlights risk with contextual severity scoring.

3. **Continuous Monitoring & Threat Detection**

Stay ahead of evolving threats with intelligent real-time monitoring:

* Detects unusual tool activity, malicious actor behavior, and abnormal API patterns.
* Visualizes threats by actor, IP address, country, and reputation.
* Enables early detection of misuse and lateral movement.
