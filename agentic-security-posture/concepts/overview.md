### Key Capabilities

#### 1. API Risk Scoring

* Every API is **scored based on its risk level**, making it easy to prioritize remediation.
* Helps security teams focus on the APIs that pose the greatest potential business and compliance risk.

#### 2. Compliance Alignment with API Security

* Maps APIs against **regulatory frameworks** such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS.
* Highlights compliance gaps and provides visibility into what needs fixing.
* Enables **automated compliance checks** so that you can continuously validate security posture.

#### 3. Misconfiguration Detection

* Detects common API misconfigurations including:
  * Missing authentication
  * Weak authorization
  * CORS issues
* Flags misconfigured APIs before attackers can exploit them.

#### 4. Sensitive Data Detection

* Identifies APIs that **expose or transmit sensitive data types** like PII, PHI, or financial data.
* Helps ensure sensitive data is **properly secured and masked** where necessary.

#### 5. Unauthenticated & Publicly Exposed APIs

* Flags APIs that are accessible **without authentication controls**.
* Identifies APIs that are **publicly exposed to the internet**, reducing attack surface.
