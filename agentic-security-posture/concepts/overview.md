# Overview

Akto's Agentic Security Posture provides a comprehensive view of critical security information across your AI agents, MCP endpoints, and LLM components. Track identified vulnerabilities, data exposure risks through agent interactions, and test coverage across autonomous systems, enabling proactive management of agentic security risks.

### Key Capabilities

#### 1. Agent Component Risk Scoring

* Every agent component and MCP endpoint is **scored based on its risk level**, prioritizing remediation efforts
* Helps security teams focus on autonomous systems that pose the greatest business and compliance risk
* Factors in prompt injection vulnerability, tool permission scope, and data sensitivity

#### 2. Compliance Alignment for Agentic Systems

* Maps agent components and MCP endpoints against **regulatory frameworks** including GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS
* Highlights compliance gaps specific to autonomous systems and LLM data processing
* Enables **automated compliance checks** for continuous validation of agentic security posture

#### 3. Agentic Misconfiguration Detection

* Detects common misconfigurations in AI agents and MCP implementations:
  * Missing authentication on agent endpoints
  * Overly permissive tool access
  * Weak authorization boundaries between agent components
  * Insecure prompt handling
  * CORS issues in MCP servers
* Flags misconfigured agents before attackers exploit them

#### 4. Sensitive Data Detection in Agent Flows

* Identifies agent components that **expose or transmit sensitive data** like PII, PHI, or financial information
* Monitors data leakage through agent interactions, tool calls, and LLM responses
* Ensures sensitive data is **properly secured and masked** in agent workflows

#### 5. Unauthenticated & Publicly Exposed Agent Components

* Flags agent endpoints and MCP servers accessible **without authentication controls**
* Identifies tools and components **publicly exposed to the internet**, reducing attack surface
* Monitors unauthorized access to agent capabilities and tool integrations
