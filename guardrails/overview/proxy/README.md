# Proxy

Deploy Akto protection proxies to secure your AI agents and MCP servers with real-time threat detection and blocking, analyzing every interaction and stopping attacks before they reach your systems.

* [MCP Proxy](../../getting-started/agentic-guardrails/akto-mcp-proxy.md) - Specialized protection for Model Context Protocol servers, tools, resources, and schema compliance
* [Agent Proxy](../../getting-started/agentic-guardrails/akto-agent-proxy.md) - Comprehensive protection for AI agents, LLM applications, and tool permission enforcement

After deployment, view detected threats in your [Guardrails dashboard](../README.md), [discover agents](../../agentic-discovery/get-started/) across your infrastructure, or [run security tests](../../agentic-red-teaming/get-started/) to identify vulnerabilities.
