# For MCP Protection Issues

Akto not only detects malicious behavior in real time through its Guardrails engine, but also provides remediation guidance to help you reduce risk and improve your agentic security posture immediately. These recommendations are directly accessible from the platform to support fast and informed action.

### Accessing Remediation for MCP Protection Issues

1. Go to the Guardrails â†’ Threat Activity section in the Akto sidebar
2. Select the relevant attack or flagged event targeting your MCP endpoints
3. Click on the payload or alert to open its detailed view
4. Open the Remediation tab to view suggested next steps


### What the Remediation Tab Includes

1. **Description of the threat:** Provides context on the observed behavior, such as prompt injection attempts, tool abuse, data exfiltration through MCP endpoints, schema violations, or authentication misuse
2. **Example implementation:** In many cases, guidance includes example code or configuration templates to help you apply the fix to your MCP servers
3. **Built-in response options:** Actions such as blocking IP addresses, restricting tool access, or creating Jira tickets can be triggered directly from the interface

### After Applying Remediation

1. Monitor the affected MCP endpoint or IP for recurrence
2. Retest or revalidate the affected MCP component if needed
3. Use integrated ticketing to track resolution
