# Overview

Akto Argus secures homegrown AI agents, MCP servers, and GenAI applications across the full lifecycle; from pre-deployment in CI/CD to runtime enforcement in cloud environments. Argus provides visibility, continuous security assessment, and runtime guardrails for autonomous AI systems that traditional AppSec and cloud security tools cannot adequately protect.

## The Problem You Face

Engineering teams are rapidly deploying AI agents, MCP servers, and GenAI applications into production. Security teams are expected to secure these systems, but face structural gaps:

* You lack clear visibility into which AI agents, MCP servers, and GenAI applications are running across cloud environments.
* AI agent behavior evolves dynamically at runtime, making static or pre-deployment testing insufficient.
* Most AI agents ship without runtime controls, exposing production systems to prompt injection, tool abuse, unsafe actions, and data leakage.

## How Akto Argus Helps

Akto Argus is purpose-built for securing autonomous and agentic AI systems. Argus integrates directly into your CI/CD pipelines and cloud runtime to help you discover, test, and control AI behavior before and after deployment.

### Why Argus Is Different

Traditional AppSec and cloud security platforms were designed for deterministic applications. Autonomous AI agents operate with dynamic prompts, tools, and decision paths, which require continuous assessment and runtime enforcement. Argus addresses these gaps with AI-specific discovery, testing, and guardrails.

## Core Capabilities

### Discover Agentic AI in Your Cloud

* Automatically discover AI agents, MCP servers, and GenAI applications across cloud environments.
* Maintain a continuously updated inventory of agentic AI assets across development, staging, and production.

### Continuous Agentic AI Red Teaming

* Use Akto’s 4,000+ AI-specific probes to continuously test AI agents, MCPs, and GenAI applications in CI/CD.
* Identify risks such as prompt injection, tool misuse, unsafe actions, policy bypass, and emerging attack patterns.

### Enforce Runtime Guardrails

* Define and enforce policies that control what AI agents can and cannot do in production.
* Restrict sensitive actions, tools, topics, and data access during runtime execution.

### Enterprise-Ready Deployment

* Deploy using Akto’s 50+ connectors, eBPF-based visibility, and cloud-native integrations.
* Route traffic through Akto’s MCP Proxy or AI Gateway for centralized control.
* Integrate with popular agent frameworks and platforms such as AWS Bedrock, n8n, and Databricks.

## Next Step: Homegrown Agentic Discovery

Begin by setting up [**Homegrown Agentic Discovery**](connectors/) to automatically identify AI agents, MCP servers, and GenAI applications running in your cloud. This establishes the inventory required for continuous testing and runtime guardrails.
