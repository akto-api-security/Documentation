# Portkey

Akto supports integration with Portkey to provide visibility and guardrail enforcement for LLM traffic routed through the Portkey gateway.

Akto Argus ingests prompts and responses processed by Portkey and evaluates the traffic against configured guardrail policies. Security and platform teams can monitor policy violations, detect anomalous model behaviour, and investigate LLM activity from a centralized dashboard.
