# Red team existing Agentic Asset

Run comprehensive security tests on your already discovered AI agents, MCP servers, and models to identify vulnerabilities before attackers do.

## Run Security Tests

Once your agentic assets are discovered and inventoried in Akto, you can immediately start testing them with [1000+ specialized security probes](/broken/pages/Et6PgCfroa4umh0CPo3K) designed for AI agents and MCP servers.

### Quick Steps

1. Navigate to [**Agentic Red Teaming**](../concepts/ai-agent-security.md) in your Akto dashboard
2. Select the assets you want to test from your inventory
3. Choose from available test categories (prompt injection, tool abuse, data leakage, etc.)
4. Click [**Run Tests**](../how-to/run-test.md) to start scanning
5. Review results and remediation guidance

## After Testing

Once tests complete:

1. **Review Results** - See all identified vulnerabilities with severity levels
2. **Get Remediation Guidance** - Follow step-by-step fixes for each issue
3. **Export Reports** - Share findings with your team
4. **Enable Guardrails** - Deploy [real-time protection](../../../agentic-guardrails/overview/) to block threats in production
