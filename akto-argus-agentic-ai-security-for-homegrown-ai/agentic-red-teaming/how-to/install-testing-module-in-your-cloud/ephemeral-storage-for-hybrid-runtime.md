Ephemeral storage in a hybrid runtime environment provides temporary, non-persistent storage that is tightly coupled with the lifecycle of pods or containers. This type of storage is ideal for use cases where data needs to be cached, buffered, or processed temporarily without long-term persistence. In hybrid deployments—combining on-premise and cloud infrastructure—effective management of ephemeral storage ensures optimal performance and resource utilization, especially for workloads like Kafka, which benefit from fast local disk I/O during data processing.
