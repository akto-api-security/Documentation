# Remediation

When security issues are detected in your agent components, MCP endpoints, or LLM integrations, Akto provides detailed remediation steps with practical code examples. Navigate to `Reports > Issues` and select any security issue to access its remediation guide in the 'Remediation' tab.

Each guide includes step-by-step instructions, code snippets in relevant programming languages, and explanations of the agentic vulnerability context.

This helps AI/ML and development teams understand not just what to fix, but how to implement the fix correctly using industry best practices and secure coding patterns for autonomous systems.
