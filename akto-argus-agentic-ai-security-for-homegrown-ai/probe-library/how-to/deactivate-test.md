# Deactivate Test

Akto provides you with a feature to deactivate the custom test. It ensures that users don't encounter any inaccurate or obsolete results, thereby maintaining the integrity of the security testing process.

Additionally, deactivation facilitates maintenance and updates by preventing false results or errors during system updates or modifications.

In the demonstration below, we have deactivated the test named **“Broken Authentication by removing the auth token.”**

Go to the **Test Editor.** Select a **Custom test** from the **Custom Test Collection** that you want to deactivate. Click on the **“x”** button to inactive the test.
