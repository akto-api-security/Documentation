# Edit Test

If you want to make small changes in Akto Test Library, you can use Akto's test editor.

Customization of tests assists in improving security coverage, adaptability to change, and incorporation of business knowledge.

In the demonstration below, let’s edit an Akto test by selecting a pre-existing test named **“Broken Authentication by removing auth token”** under the test category **“Broken User Authentication (BUA).”**

Go to **Test Editor** to edit Akto's test. Choose **test collection > pre-existing test**. Customize the **YAML file** based on your requirements, then click on **Save** to save the custom test.

In the demonstration above, we have selected a pre-existing test named **“Broken Authentication by removing auth token”** under the test category **“Broken User Authentication (BUA)”** and customized the YAML file by changing **“api\_selection\_filters”** for **“response\_code”** between 500 and 700. It will create a new test in the list.
