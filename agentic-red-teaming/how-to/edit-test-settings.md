# Edit Test Settings

From the test results page, you can edit test settings and re-run tests directly without creating a new test run.

## Editing and Re-running Tests

1. Navigate to **Agentic Red Teaming > Results**
2. Select the test run you want to modify
3. Click **Edit test settings**
4. Adjust parameters such as:
   - Test categories
   - Rate limits
   - Authentication settings
   - Target components
5. Click **Re-run test** to execute with updated settings

This allows quick iteration on test configurations without starting from scratch.
