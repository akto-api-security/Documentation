# Recalculate Issue Counts

You can recalculate issue counts directly from the test results page to keep vulnerability data accurate.

## Recalculating Counts

1. Navigate to **Agentic Red Teaming > Results**
2. Select the test run
3. Click **Recalculate issue counts**

This ensures vulnerability statistics reflect the current state after any manual issue triaging or status updates.
