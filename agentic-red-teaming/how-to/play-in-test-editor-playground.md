# Play in Test Editor Playground

Play in Test Editor Playground Akto Test Editor allows you to create and customize API security tests. It gives you access to over 100 built-in tests and uses YAML for easy writing and understanding. It also lets you test against a sample API for real-time feedback. This is perfect for both finding prebuilt security tests and creating custom ones.

In the demonstration below, we use Akto's Test Editor to run a pre-built test against the **`rest/captcha`** endpoint of the **`juice_shop_demo`** collection to detect any potential vulnerabilities within the API.
