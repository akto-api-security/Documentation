# Create a Test Role

If you use role-based access control in your agentic systems, you should test for privilege escalation issues. This involves determining if a lower-privilege role has access to higher-privilege agent components or tools.

Akto automates privilege escalation security tests for agentic systems. You should define as many roles as exist in your application. For example, if you're running a B2B SaaS with AI agents, you might have ADMIN, MEMBER, VIEWER, and GUEST roles. Role creation is a one-time configuration.

## Creating a Test Role

1. Navigate to **Agentic Red Teaming > Scan Roles**
2. Click **Create New Test Role**
3. Enter the role name
4. Specify role component conditions (which collections or components this role can access)
5. Click **Save**

## Adding Auth Token for Role

You can add a hard-coded token for quick testing, but for daily tests or CI/CD integration, use Automated Auth setup. For TLS-based authentication, configure TLS Authentication.

### Hard-coded Auth Token

1. Navigate to **Scan Roles**
2. Click the menu icon (**...**) for the role
3. Click **Add Auth**
4. Enter the auth header key and value (e.g., `Authorization` and `Bearer token`)
5. Click **Save**

You can add header conditions to use the auth token only for specific scenarios.

### Automated Auth Token Generation

For continuous testing, set Akto to automatically fetch fresh auth tokens before each test run. This ensures tests use valid authentication.

1. **Configure Request Details**: Set up the API call details including URL, method, headers, and body to obtain a token.

2. **Execute the Call**: Test the API call to verify it returns an auth token.

3. **Extract Token**: Identify where the token appears in the response (header or body) and configure extraction.

Akto will execute this sequence before running tests to fetch a fresh auth token, enabling daily tests and CI/CD integration without token expiry issues.

### TLS Authentication

To add TLS authentication:

1. Create a test role and click **Add auth**
2. Click **TLS Authentication**
3. For PEM certificate type:
   - Input the client certificate
   - Input the client private key
   - Input the certificate authority certificate (optional)
4. Click **Save**

If you have a P12 type key, convert it to PEM using:

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -in ./client.p12 -out client.crt -clcerts -nokeys
openssl pkcs12 -in ./client.p12 -out client.key -nocerts -nodes
```

You can limit visibility of a Test Role using RBAC with the "Scope Role" dropdown. For details, see [Restrict Access to a Test Role Using RBAC](restrict-test-role-rbac.md).
