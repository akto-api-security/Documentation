# Rescan Specific Issues Resolved

You can use Akto to rescan individual issues after they've been fixed, instead of running a full security test. This allows quick validation of specific fixes.

## Rescan Specific Issues

1. Navigate to **Agentic Red Teaming > Results**
2. Find the test where the issue was detected
3. Locate the issue(s) you want to retest
4. Check the box next to the issue(s)
5. Click **Rerun tests** to rescan selected issues

Akto will automatically rerun tests for the selected agent components and update the issue status.

## Review Results

After the scan completes:

- If the issue is fixed, it moves to the **No vulnerability found** tab
- If the issue persists, it remains under **Vulnerable**
- You can repeat the rescan anytime as needed
