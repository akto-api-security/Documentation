# Stop Tests

You can stop tests in Akto at any time if there are changes in agent components, parameters, authentication methods, or the test environment. Stopping tests allows you to make necessary adjustments to ensure accurate and meaningful results.

## Stopping a Running Test

1. Navigate to **Agentic Red Teaming > Results**
2. Locate the running test you want to stop
3. Click the menu icon (**...**) next to the test
4. Select **Stop** to halt the test execution

Tests can be stopped immediately without affecting previously collected results. This is useful when agent configurations change or when you need to adjust test parameters.
