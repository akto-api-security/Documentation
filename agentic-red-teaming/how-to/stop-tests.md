# Stop Tests

You can stop the tests in Akto at any time if there are changes in the API endpoints, parameters, authentication methods, or test environment. Stopping tests allows you to make necessary adjustments in the test scripts accordingly to ensure accurate and meaningful results.&#x20;

In the demonstration below, we stop the test named **“test\_for\_one\_endpoint.”**

Go to **Testing > Results.** Click on **"..."** and select **“Stop”** to stop the respective test.
