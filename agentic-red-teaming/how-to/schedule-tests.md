# Schedule Tests

Akto enables you to schedule tests for agent components, ensuring consistent and regular security validation. By scheduling tests to run at predetermined intervals, you can continuously monitor security posture and detect potential vulnerabilities before they escalate.

## Scheduling Tests for Agent Components

1. Navigate to **Agentic Discovery > Collections**
2. Select the collection containing agent components you want to test
3. Click **Run Test**
4. Select test categories (Prompt Injection, MCP Security, LLM Security, etc.)
5. Choose specific tests or select all tests in the category
6. Click **Schedule** to set the time trigger
7. Configure schedule (daily, weekly, or custom interval)
8. Click **Run Test** to activate the schedule

## Viewing Scheduled Test Results

Scheduled tests run automatically at configured intervals. Results are available in **Agentic Red Teaming > Results**.

By analyzing scheduled test results, you can identify and address vulnerabilities, ensuring agent components function securely and meet security requirements. Results inform decisions related to security improvements, guardrail adjustments, and tool permission refinements.
