# Test Role

By defining Test Roles in Akto, you can ensure that your API enforces the correct access controls and does not allow unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality. You can create custom test roles and define the role endpoint conditions for various users or scenarios, making sure that each role only can perform the actions they require.

For more information on creating a Test Role, please refer to the documentation- [Create a Test Role](../how-to/create-a-test-role.md).
