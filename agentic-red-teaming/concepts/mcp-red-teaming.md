# MCP Red Teaming

The Akto MCP Security Module is designed for teams working with LLMs, agent frameworks, and AI-based orchestration systems. As Model Context Protocol (MCP) becomes a standard layer in agentic stacks, it introduces new attack surfaces that are often unmonitored and untested.

Akto automatically identifies MCP servers, discovers tool definitions and resources, runs targeted security tests, and continuously monitors for misconfigurations, threats, and data leaks in real time.

## Key Capabilities

### MCP Server Discovery

Gain instant visibility into every MCP server in your environment:

- Automatically detects MCP servers and the tools they expose
- Works across cloud, hybrid, and on-prem environments
- Maps tool dependencies and resource access patterns

### Security Testing for MCPs

Uncover critical vulnerabilities unique to MCP architectures:

**Prompt Injection**: Tests for indirect prompt injection through MCP tool responses and resource content.

**Tool Poisoning**: Validates tool definition integrity and detects malicious tool implementations.

**Excessive Permissions**: Identifies overly broad tool permissions and resource access grants.

**Unauthorized Endpoint Access**: Tests authorization boundaries for tool invocations and resource requests.

**Insecure Authentication**: Validates authentication mechanisms for MCP server connections.

**MCP Protocol Security**: Tests for protocol-specific vulnerabilities including malformed requests and response manipulation.

Each test simulates real-world attack paths with contextual severity scoring.

### Continuous Monitoring

Stay ahead of threats with real-time monitoring:

- Detects unusual tool invocation patterns and malicious actor behavior
- Visualizes threats by actor, IP address, and reputation
- Enables early detection of tool misuse and lateral movement
