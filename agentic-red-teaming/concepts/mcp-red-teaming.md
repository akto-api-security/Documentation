# MCP Red Teaming

The Akto MCP Security Module is designed for teams working with LLMs, agent frameworks, or AI-based orchestration systems. As MCPs become a new layer in modern application stacks, they also introduce new attack surfaces â€” often unmonitored and untested. Akto brings complete visibility and protection with zero friction.

Akto automatically identifies MCP servers, discovers associated API endpoints, runs targeted security tests, and continuously monitors for misconfigurations, threats, and data leaks â€” all in real time.
