# User Config

Configure test settings to enable comprehensive security testing of agentic systems. User config allows you to set up authentication tokens, rate limits, and global test parameters.

## Configure Global Rate Limit

Set rate limits to control the number of requests per second during testing. This prevents overwhelming agent components during security scans.

Navigate to **Agentic Red Teaming > User Config** and configure the global rate limit value.

## Update Ignore Time for Testing

Configure the ignore time to prevent repeated testing of recently scanned components. This helps optimize testing resources and focus on components that haven't been validated recently.

## Configure Global Test Configuration

Set global test parameters that apply across all security scans. This includes timeout values, retry logic, and other test execution settings that affect how Akto interacts with your agentic components during security testing.
