# JSON Recording for Automated Auth Tokens

JSON Recording automates the process of capturing and managing authentication tokens for agentic security testing. It allows you to record the authentication flow once and reuse it automatically in security tests, ensuring consistent and reliable testing with valid authentication.

This feature is particularly useful for testing agent components that require authentication, such as LLM provider API calls, MCP server connections, or tool invocations requiring bearer tokens.
