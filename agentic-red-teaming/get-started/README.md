# Get Started

Test your AI agents, MCP servers, and AI models with 1000+ specialized security probes. Akto identifies vulnerabilities like prompt injections, tool abuse, and privilege escalation before attackers do.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Sign Up or Log In

1. Go to [app.akto.io](https://app.akto.io)
2. Sign up for a new account or log in to your existing account

### Step 2: Choose Testing Approach

**Option A: Test Existing Assets**

Already have discovered agents and MCP servers in your inventory? Start testing immediately.

→ [Red Team Existing Agentic Asset](../../akto-argus-agentic-ai-security-for-homegrown-ai/agentic-red-teaming/get-started/red-team-existing-agentic-asset.md)

**Option B: Import New Components**

Navigate to **Quick Start** in your Akto dashboard and import the components you want to test:

#### Import AI Agents

Test agents from AWS Bedrock, Azure AI Foundry, Databricks, Google Vertex AI, IBM Watsonx, or custom agents.

→ [Import AI Agents](../../akto-argus-agentic-ai-security-for-homegrown-ai/agentic-red-teaming/get-started/manual-import/)

#### Import MCP Servers

Test Model Context Protocol tools, resources, and prompts by connecting to SSE endpoints.

→ [Import MCP Servers](../../akto-argus-agentic-ai-security-for-homegrown-ai/agentic-red-teaming/get-started/manual-import/)

#### Import AI Models

Test large language models and custom AI implementations for security vulnerabilities.

→ [Import AI Agents](../../akto-argus-agentic-ai-security-for-homegrown-ai/agentic-red-teaming/get-started/manual-import/)

### Step 3: Run Security Tests

Once imported:

1. Navigate to **Agentic Red Teaming** in your dashboard
2. Select the components you want to test
3. Choose from 1000+ specialized security probes
4. Click **Run Tests** to start scanning

### Step 4: Review Results

After tests complete:

1. View all identified vulnerabilities
2. See detailed exploit scenarios
3. Get remediation guidance for each issue
4. Export reports for your team

## What Gets Tested

Akto tests for:

* Prompt injection attacks
* Tool permission escalation
* Data leakage vulnerabilities
* Authentication bypass
* MCP schema violations
* Supply chain risks

## Next Steps

* Set up continuous testing with [discovery agents](../../agentic-ai-discovery/get-started.md)
* Enable [Guardrails](../../agentic-guardrails/overview/) to block threats in production
* Review compliance posture against security frameworks
