# Manual Import

Directly import your AI agents, MCP servers, and AI models into Akto for immediate security testing without deploying discovery agents or connecting to your infrastructure.

## What You Can Import

### AI Agent Import

Import AI agents from AWS Bedrock, Azure AI Foundry, Databricks, Google Vertex AI, IBM Watsonx, or custom implementations. Provide your agent endpoint URL and optional configuration to start testing.

### MCP Import

Import Model Context Protocol servers by connecting to their SSE endpoints. Akto automatically discovers all tools, resources, and prompts available on your MCP server.

### AI Model Import

Import large language models like Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, DeepSeek, Llama, Grok, or custom AI implementations for comprehensive security testing.

## Quick Import Steps

1. Navigate to **Quick Start** in your Akto dashboard
2. Select the component type you want to import
3. Provide endpoint URL and optional authentication details
4. Click **Import** to add to your inventory

## After Import

Once imported, you can:

* [Run security tests](../README.md) with 1000+ specialized probes to identify vulnerabilities
* View all components in your [Agentic Discovery](../../../agentic-discovery/get-started/) dashboard
* [Enable Guardrails](../../../guardrails/overview.md) for real-time threat protection in production
