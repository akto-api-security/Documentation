# Manual Import

Directly import your AI agents, MCP servers, and AI models into Akto for immediate security testing without deploying discovery agents or connecting to your infrastructure.

Import AI agents from AWS Bedrock, Azure AI Foundry, Databricks, Google Vertex AI, IBM Watsonx, or custom implementations. Import MCP servers by connecting to their SSE endpoints. Import large language models and custom AI implementations for comprehensive security testing.

Once imported, [run security tests](../README.md) to identify vulnerabilities, view components in your [Agentic Discovery](../../../agentic-discovery/get-started/) dashboard, or [enable Guardrails](../../../guardrails/overview.md) for real-time protection.
