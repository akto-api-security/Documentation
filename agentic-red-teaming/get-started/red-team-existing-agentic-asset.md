# Red Team Existing Agentic Asset

Run comprehensive security tests on your already discovered AI agents, MCP servers, and models to identify vulnerabilities before attackers do.

## Run Security Tests

Once your agentic assets are discovered and inventoried in Akto, you can immediately start testing them with 1000+ specialized security probes designed for AI agents and MCP servers.

### Quick Steps

1. Navigate to **Agentic Red Teaming** in your Akto dashboard
2. Select the assets you want to test from your inventory
3. Choose from available test categories (prompt injection, tool abuse, data leakage, etc.)
4. Click **Run Tests** to start scanning
5. Review results and remediation guidance

## Test Documentation

For detailed instructions on running tests:

* [Run Tests](../../how-to/run-test.md) - Complete guide to running security tests on agents and MCP servers
* [Run Tests by Category](../../how-to/run-tests-by-category.md) - Filter and run specific test categories
* [Run Tests in CLI](../../how-to/run-tests-in-cli-using-akto.md) - Automate testing in your CI/CD pipeline

## What Gets Tested

Akto tests for:
* Prompt injection attacks
* Tool permission escalation
* Data leakage vulnerabilities
* Authentication bypass
* MCP schema violations
* Supply chain risks

## After Testing

Once tests complete:

1. **Review Results** - See all identified vulnerabilities with severity levels
2. **Get Remediation Guidance** - Follow step-by-step fixes for each issue
3. **Export Reports** - Share findings with your team
4. **Enable Guardrails** - Deploy [real-time protection](../../../guardrails/overview.md) to block threats in production
