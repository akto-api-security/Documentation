# AI Security

With the rise of large language models (LLMs), securing the APIs behind LLMs and chatbots is critical. Akto protects these APIs through four key pillars, with deep coverage of OWASP Top 10 LLM vulnerabilities.

***

### **1. API Discovery**

The first step in securing your APIs is knowing what you have. Akto continuously scans your environments to discover all active and shadow APIs, including those interacting with LLMs. It maps endpoints, classifies sensitive data, and maintains an up-to-date inventory. This visibility is essential to managing risk in dynamic AI environments where APIs frequently evolve.

**Key Capabilities:**

* Automated detection of APIs, including internal, third-party, and LLM endpoints
* Classification of data and identification of PII, secrets, and LLM-specific payloads
* Real-time inventory and change tracking

***

### **2. API Security Testing**

Akto enables proactive security by running automated tests to uncover vulnerabilities in APIs behind LLMs and chatbots. With over 1000 test templates modeled on OWASP’s Top 10 for LLM applications, Akto detects issues like prompt injection, system prompt leakage, vector embedding weaknesses, and data poisoning.

**Key Capabilities:**

* 1000+ test templates based on real-world LLM attack scenarios
* Prebuilt and custom test suites for LLM-specific APIs
* Integration with CI/CD pipelines for shift-left testing

***

### **3. Threat Protection**

With APIs behind LLMs facing unique threats such as misinformation, unbounded consumption, and improper output handling, Akto provides real-time protection against these and more. It monitors for anomalies specific to AI workloads, blocks malicious traffic, and flags abuses like repeated prompt probing or excessive API usage.

**Key Capabilities:**

* Detection and prevention of LLM-specific threats
* Behavioral modeling to detect anomalous user interactions with AI endpoints

***

### **4. API Security Posture**

API Security Posture serves as a unified overview of all the above pillars—Discovery, Testing, and Threat Protection. It helps security teams understand the overall security health of LLM-integrated APIs. Akto provides visibility into risks, trends, severities and coverage gaps, and enforces security policies aligned with OWASP GenAI Security standards.

**Key Capabilities:**

* Posture assessments aligned with OWASP GenAI Security Project
* Aggregated tracking of risk scores, findings, and compliance gaps
* Actionable insights and prioritized recommendations based on all three layers
