### Key Capabilities

#### 1. Automated validation of test results

* Re-runs and validates findings across different API endpoints
* Filters out inaccurate or duplicate results
* Reduces noise in vulnerability reports

#### 2. Error detection and failure testing

* Identifies common patterns that lead to false positives
* Ensures only reliable findings are surfaced for remediation
* Improves quality assurance efficiency in security testing

#### 3. API-level analysis

* Maps potential false positives to affected API endpoints
* Highlights which specific APIs were incorrectly flagged
* Provides clear visibility into root causes of testing errors

#### 4. Integration into testing workflows

* Works seamlessly with Akto’s testing engine
* Supports integration into CI/CD pipelines to reduce false alarms early
* Ensures developers are not slowed down by inaccurate security findings
