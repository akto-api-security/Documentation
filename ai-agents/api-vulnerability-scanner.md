# API Vulnerability Scanner

The API Vulnerability Scanner agent runs legacy and modern API security checks without requiring manual intervention. It continuously validates APIs for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and data exposures using self-running workflows, ensuring that security keeps pace with rapid development cycles.
