# API Grouping Agent

The **API Grouping Agent** in Akto organizes APIs into logical service groups, making it easier to manage large inventories. Instead of dealing with hundreds of scattered endpoints, Akto intelligently clusters them into business-oriented categories such as _User Management_, _Payment Processing_, or _Billing Services_.

This helps teams quickly understand the purpose of each API set, track vulnerabilities at a service level, and prioritize remediation.
