# Set environment type

If you are tracking and testing multiple environments through Akto, you can mark your API collections as **Staging** or **Production**.&#x20;

It will help you in triaging alerts - for example, urgency for a new Sensitive Data in `Production` vs `Staging` . Similarly, testing shouldn't be done on collections marked as `Production`.&#x20;

To set environment type for an API collection, go to **API Discovery** > **API Collections**. Select any number of API Collections from the table and click on `Set env type`.&#x20;

Note that collections that have the word `demo` or `staging` in them are already marked as `Staging`.&#x20;
