You can create API groups in two ways:

1. From existing endpoints:
   * Select the desired endpoints from your API inventory
   * Choose "Add to API group" from the available actions
   * Select "New API group" and provide a name for the group
2. Create a new group:
   * Select the desired endpoints from your API inventory
   * Select "Create new group"
   * Provide a name for the group and add endpoints to the group.
