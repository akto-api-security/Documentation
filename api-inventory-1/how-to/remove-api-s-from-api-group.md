To remove APIs from an API group in Akto:

1. Navigate to the API group from API Discovery page in Akto.
2. Select the checkbox next to the API(s) you want to remove from the group.
3. Once selected, a menu will appear at the bottom of the list.
4. Click on the "Remove from API group" button in this menu.

This action will remove the selected API(s) from the current API group without deleting them from your overall API inventory. The APIs will still exist in your system but will no longer be associated with this particular group.

Note that you can select multiple APIs at once for bulk removal from the group.
