# Environment Type

The Environment Type feature in Akto allows users to tag API collections as either Staging or Production. This helps teams prioritize testing and triage alerts based on the environment’s criticality. Learn [How to Set Environment Type](../../api-inventory/how-to/set-tags.md).

### Helps with:

1. **Tagging API Collections:** Label collections as Staging or Production for better management.
2. **Environment-Specific Testing:** Adjust testing efforts based on the environment, avoiding unnecessary tests in Production while prioritizing urgent issues there.
3. **Efficient Triaging:** Alerts for sensitive data or vulnerabilities in Production are prioritized over Staging, ensuring quick action where it’s most needed.
