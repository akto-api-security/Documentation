# API Changes

If you want to check all the API endpoints and Parameters that have been newly added to your API collection or APIs that have experienced changes, you can navigate to the API change section from the Akto Dashboard.

In the demonstration below, we'll review the changes in the API over the past two months.

Go to the **API Discovery > API Changes**. All new APIs are listed here. Click on any new **API endpoint** to view its details.&#x20;

In the above demonstration, we observed that 109 new endpoints were introduced in the last two months, out of which, two of them are sharing sensitive data. For example, the endpoint **`rest/admin/application-configur`** is sending out an **`Email ID`** in its response.

You can also configure alerts on API changes.  For more information on how to create your webhook alert, refer to this [link](https://docs.akto.io/api-inventory/how-to/configure-alerts-on-api-changes).
