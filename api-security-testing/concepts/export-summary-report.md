# Export Summary Report

### Overview

The **Summary Report** in Akto provides a high-level snapshot of an API security scan. It is ideal for **executives, compliance teams, and managers** who need quick insights into the security posture without diving into raw technical data.

The report highlights the **number of vulnerabilities, their severity distribution, categories affected, and scan configuration details**.
