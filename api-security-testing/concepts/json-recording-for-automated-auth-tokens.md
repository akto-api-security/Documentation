# JSON Recording for Automated Auth Tokens

JSON Recording is a feature in Akto that automates the process of capturing and managing authentication tokens for API testing. It allows you to record the authentication flow once and reuse it automatically in your security tests, ensuring consistent and reliable API testing with valid authentication.
