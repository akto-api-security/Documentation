# Magic Operator

The **Magic Operator** (`$magic`) allows you to dynamically inject smart behavior into your test templates using natural language prompts. By prefixing a command with `$magic`, the engine interprets the instruction and performs intelligent actions—such as automatically modifying, deleting, or generating headers, payloads, or validations—without hardcoding logic. In the example shown, `$magic delete sec headers` instructs the engine to remove security-related headers from the request, making it easier to simulate real-world attack conditions or bypass scenarios. This operator greatly enhances flexibility and automation in crafting API test cases by leveraging AI-driven contextual understanding.
