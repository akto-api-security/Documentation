# Severity Levels

Akto classifies API security vulnerabilities into four severity levels to help teams prioritize their remediation efforts. Each level indicates the potential impact on your API security posture and guides response timing.

### Critical Severity

Critical severity issues pose immediate risk to API security and require urgent attention. These vulnerabilities could lead to unauthorized data access, system compromise, or service disruption. Immediate remediation is essential.

### High Severity

High severity issues indicate significant API security risks requiring prompt remediation. While not as immediately dangerous as Critical issues, these vulnerabilities can severely impact API integrity and data security if exploited.

### Medium Severity

Medium severity issues represent moderate risks to API security. These vulnerabilities might affect specific API endpoints or security controls, requiring planned remediation within standard development cycles.

### Low Severity

Low severity findings indicate minor API security concerns. While these issues don't pose immediate threats, they represent opportunities to strengthen API security controls and should be addressed during regular maintenance.
