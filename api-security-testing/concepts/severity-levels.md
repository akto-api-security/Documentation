# Severity Levels

Akto classifies API security vulnerabilities into four severity levels to help teams prioritize their remediation efforts. Each level indicates the potential impact on your API security posture and guides response timing.

## Different Severity Levels

<table><thead><tr><th width="156.76953125">Severity Level</th><th width="253.87890625">Description</th><th>Risk &#x26; Action Required</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Critical</strong></td><td>Issues that pose an immediate risk to API security.</td><td>Can lead to unauthorised data access, system compromise, or service disruption. <strong>Immediate remediation is essential.</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>High</strong></td><td>Significant API security risks requiring prompt attention.</td><td>Not as immediately dangerous as Critical issues, but can severely impact API integrity and data security if exploited.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Medium</strong></td><td>Moderate risks affecting specific API endpoints or security controls.</td><td>Should be remediated in a planned manner within standard development cycles.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Low</strong></td><td>Minor API security concerns.</td><td>Do not pose immediate threats but represent opportunities to improve security during regular maintenance.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Update Severity for a Test Result

You can also update the severity of findings generated by a specific security test run.
