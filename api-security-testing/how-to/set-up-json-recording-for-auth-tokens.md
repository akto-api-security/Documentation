# Set Up JSON Recording for Auth Tokens

### Steps to Record Auth Flow

1. Please Open your browser and click on open chrome dev tools
2. Open recorder tab and click on "Start a New Recording"
3. Run the complete login flow, and stop the recording once done.
4. Click on the download icon just above, and select "Export as a json file"
5. Go to Akto dashboard and specify the token fetch command, which will be used by AKTO to extract the token
6. Specify the json script in AKTO Dashboard, and wait for couple of minutes for verifying the extracted token

### Common Issues

* Invalid token format: Verify token fetch command syntax
* Upload fails: Check JSON file format
* Token not found: Ensure recording includes complete auth flow
