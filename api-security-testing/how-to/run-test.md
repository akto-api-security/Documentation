# Run Test

Running security tests in Akto involves assessing specific parts of your API endpoints to assess their security posture. With Akto, you have the flexibility to run the tests instantly or schedule a single test run for a later time. This feature is particularly useful for planning future testing sessions or implementing regular tests. The Akto testing module contains 1000+ templates that you can use just out of the box.

In the demonstration below, let's run tests on <mark style="color:red;">`/rest/product/search`</mark> endpoint within **demo\_collection**.

For example, we'll be running all the test categories on the <mark style="color:red;">`/rest/products/search`</mark> endpoint of the **demo\_collection** API.

In the demonstration above, we performed tests on the <mark style="color:red;">`/rest/products/search`</mark> endpoint from the **demo\_collection** API.

### Add/modify/delete headers/params

Easily add, modify, or remove headers like “x-forwarded-for” or “x-no-alarm” directly from the test configuration, without editing YAML files.
