# Vulnerability Report

View and analyze security vulnerabilities detected across all of your AI agents, MCP endpoints, and LLM components in Akto.

### What is a Vulnerability Report?

Vulnerability Reports are comprehensive assessments that identify, categorize, and prioritize security weaknesses within your agentic infrastructure. They provide detailed insights into potential threats targeting autonomous systems, their impact, and recommended remediation steps, enabling you to strengthen your overall agentic security posture.

### View a Vulnerability Report

Akto automatically generates Vulnerability Reports based on continuous agentic security testing. By viewing these reports, you get a detailed overview of your agent components' security status and potential risks.

This includes details of:

* **Issue Categories**: Types of vulnerabilities detected (e.g., Prompt Injection, Tool Abuse, Permission Escalation, Data Leakage)
* **Affected Components**: Specific agent endpoints, MCP servers, or tool integrations where vulnerabilities were found
* **Severity Levels**: Impact assessment of each vulnerability (High, Medium, Low) in the context of autonomous systems
* **Why is this a problem?**: Explanation of the potential consequences if the agentic vulnerability is exploited
* **Remediation Steps**: Recommended actions to address each vulnerability in agent components
