# Vulnerability Report

View and analyze security vulnerabilities detected across all of your APIs and services in Akto.

### What is a Vulnerability Report?

Vulnerability Reports are comprehensive assessments that identify, categorize, and prioritize security weaknesses within your API infrastructure. They provide detailed insights into potential threats, their impact, and recommended remediation steps, enabling you to strengthen your overall security posture.

### View a Vulnerability Report

Akto automatically generates Vulnerability Reports based on continuous API security testing. By viewing these reports, you get a detailed overview of your API's security status and potential risks.

This includes details of:

* **Issue Categories**: Types of vulnerabilities detected (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS)
* **Affected APIs**: Specific endpoints where vulnerabilities were found
* **Severity Levels**: Impact assessment of each vulnerability (High, Medium, Low)
* **Why is this a problem?**: Explanation of the potential consequences if the vulnerability is exploited
* **Remediation Steps**: Recommended actions to address each vulnerability
