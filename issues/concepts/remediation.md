# Remediation

When security issues are detected in your API endpoints, Akto provides detailed remediation steps with practical code examples. Navigate to `Reports > Issues` and select any security issue to access its remediation guide in the 'Remediation' tab.&#x20;

Each guide includes step-by-step instructions, code snippets in relevant programming languages (such as Java Spring Boot), and explanations of the vulnerability context.&#x20;

This helps development teams understand not just what to fix, but how to implement the fix correctly using industry best practices and secure coding patterns.
