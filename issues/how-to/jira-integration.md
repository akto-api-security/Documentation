Integrate Akto with Jira to streamline your API security workflow by creating tickets for vulnerabilities directly from Akto.

### Quick Setup Steps

#### 1. Access Integrations

* Go to **Settings > Integrations**.
* Find and click **"Configure"** next to Jira.

#### 2. Enter Jira Details

* **Base URL:** Your Jira instance URL (e.g., `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net`).
* **Email:** Your Jira account email.
* **API Token:** Your Jira API token (generate in Jira).

#### 3. Add Projects

You can configure **one or multiple Jira projects**. For each project:

* **Project Key:** Enter your Jira project key (e.g., `KAN`, `DP`).
* **Enable Bi-Directional Integration (Optional):**
  * Tick the checkbox to **sync status both ways**: when Akto updates a vulnerability‚Äôs status, Jira is updated; and vice versa.
  * **Map statuses**: Define how Jira statuses map to Akto statuses:
    * Akto Status: **Open** ‚Üí Jira Status: _Select corresponding status_.
    * Akto Status: **Fixed** ‚Üí Jira Status: _Select corresponding status_.
    * Akto Status: **Ignored** ‚Üí Jira Status: _Select corresponding status_.

üí° **You can add up to 10 projects per integration.**

#### 4. Save

* Click **"Save"** to finalize.

### What Happens When You Enable/Disable Bi-Directional Integration?

#### Enabling Bi-Directional Integration:

* Once enabled for a project, Akto will **start syncing statuses every 1 hour**.
* Any status change that occurs in Jira during that hour will be **detected in the next sync cycle** and updated in Akto according to your configured mapping.
* **Existing issues** will **retain their current status** in Akto unless they are updated in Jira.
* As soon as a status change is detected in Jira (for linked tickets), Akto will **sync the new status to match the mapping you configured**.

#### Disabling Bi-Directional Integration:

* When disabled, Akto will **stop syncing status updates** from Jira for that project.
* **Existing issues** in Akto will remain unchanged and **retain their last synced status** at the time of disabling.
* **Manual status updates** in Akto will no longer reflect back in Jira, and vice versa.
* ‚úÖ **If Bi-Directional Integration is turned ON again**, Akto will **resume syncing all issue statuses that changed after the last successful sync (before turning OFF)**, ensuring no updates are missed.

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature assumes that **no separate custom workflows** are created in your Jira app. If there are any, the syncing process **might be affected** and could lead to unexpected behavior. Please review your Jira workflows to ensure compatibility.
