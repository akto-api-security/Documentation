# Review Issues Marked as False Positives

### Introduction

You can use Akto to review and manage issues marked as **False Positive** during API security testing. This lets you revisit ignored issues, check their details, and reopen them if needed.

Hereâ€™s what you can do:

* [View all false positive issues](review-issues-marked-as-false-positives.md#view-false-positive-issues)
* [Review issue details](review-issues-marked-as-false-positives.md#review-issue-details)
* [Reopen an issue if necessary](review-issues-marked-as-false-positives.md#reopen-an-issue)

***

### View False Positive Issues

1. Go to **Reports > Issues** in the Akto dashboard.
2. Click the **Ignored** tab to see all issues marked as false positives or acceptable risks.

### Review Issue Details

Click on any issue to open its details, including:

* **Overview**: Description, severity, API endpoint, authentication, sensitive data, and impact.
* **Timeline**: When the issue was detected and when it was marked as a false positive.
* **Values**: Request and response data showing the payloads tested.
* **Remediation**: Suggested steps to fix the issue (with code examples where applicable).

Use these tabs to verify why an issue was marked as false positive and if it needs action.

### Reopen an Issue

If an issue needs further investigation:

1. Open the issue and click the **Triage** dropdown.
2. Select **Reopen** to move the issue back to the Open state.

You can then assign it for remediation or create a Jira ticket for tracking.
