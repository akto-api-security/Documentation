# Overview

Akto Atlas secures AI agents, MCPs, and GenAI tools used at the endpoints where development and experimentation actually happen. Atlas provides visibility and control over AI usage on developer laptops, browsers, IDEs, and local environments—outside the traditional cloud perimeter.

## The Problem You Face

AI agents and GenAI tools are increasingly used directly from endpoints, creating unmanaged risk beyond centralized cloud infrastructure:

* You lack visibility into which AI agents, MCPs, and GenAI tools employees use across devices.
* Most organizations operate without formal guardrails for endpoint AI usage.
* Only a small fraction maintain an accurate, up-to-date inventory of AI agents and MCP connections.

Endpoint-driven AI usage is now one of the fastest-growing sources of security and governance gaps.

## How Akto Atlas Helps

Akto Atlas for Endpoints secures and governs AI usage directly at the source. Atlas discovers AI activity across employee devices and enforces guardrails without disrupting developer workflows.

### Why Atlas Is Different

Traditional endpoint security tools were not designed to understand AI agents, MCPs, or prompt-driven workflows. Atlas is built to observe and control AI-specific behaviors across browsers, IDEs, and local development environments.

## Core Capabilities

### Discover AI Usage Across Every Employee and Device

* Discover AI agents, MCPs, and GenAI tools used across:
  * Browsers
  * IDEs such as Cursor and Claude
  * Local development environments
* Identify shadow AI usage and locally spun-up MCP servers.
* Maintain a live, continuously updated inventory of endpoint AI assets.

## Enforce Guardrails at the Endpoint

* Apply guardrails to:
  * Block sensitive data exposure
  * Prevent unsafe prompts or actions
  * Restrict risky MCP tool calls
* Enforce policies using browser-based controls and Endpoint Shield.

## Enterprise-Ready Deployment

* Deploy a lightweight browser extension for rapid coverage.
* Use Endpoint Shield for deeper enforcement and visibility.
* Support all major IDEs and AI tools.
* Preserve developer productivity with no workflow disruption.

## Next Step: Endpoint Discovery Agents

Start by deploying [**Endpoint Discovery Agents**](endpoints-discovery-agents/) to gain visibility into AI agents, MCPs, and GenAI tools used across employee devices. This inventory forms the foundation for enforcing endpoint guardrails and governance.
