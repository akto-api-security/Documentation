# Browser Extensions

Discover and test your AI agents and MCP servers directly from your browser. Akto's browser extensions capture agent interactions in real-time as you use your AI applications, making it easy to discover and secure your agentic components without complex setup.

## How It Works

Browser extensions monitor your AI agent interactions as you browse and automatically send the traffic to Akto for discovery and analysis. This approach is perfect for:

* Testing AI applications during development
* Discovering shadow agents in your organization
* Quick security validation without infrastructure changes
* Capturing MCP server interactions from web applications

## Available Extensions

* [Chrome Extension](chrome.md) - For Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers
* [Firefox Extension](firefox.md) - For Mozilla Firefox
* [Safari Extension](safari.md) - For Safari on macOS

## When to Use Browser Extensions

Browser extensions are ideal when you:

* Want to discover agents without deploying infrastructure
* Need to quickly test a specific AI application
* Are evaluating Akto before full deployment
* Want to capture agent behavior during manual testing

For production environments with continuous monitoring, consider [homegrown discovery agents](../../../akto-argus-agentic-ai-security-for-homegrown-ai/homegrown-discovery-agents/) instead.
