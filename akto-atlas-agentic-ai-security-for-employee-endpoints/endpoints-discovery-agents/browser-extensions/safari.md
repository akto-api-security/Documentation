Discover AI agents and MCP servers directly from Safari on macOS. The Akto Safari extension captures agent interactions in real-time as you browse.

## Installation

1. Install the Akto extension from the App Store
2. Enable the extension in Safari preferences
3. Configure your Akto dashboard connection
4. Start browsing your AI applications

The extension will automatically capture and send agent traffic to your Akto dashboard for discovery and security analysis.

## What Gets Captured

The Safari extension monitors:

* AI agent API calls and responses
* MCP server interactions
* Tool invocations and parameters
* Authentication tokens and headers
* Request/response payloads

All captured data is sent securely to your Akto instance for analysis.

## Requirements

* Safari on macOS (latest version recommended)
* Active Akto account or self-hosted instance
* Network access to your Akto dashboard

## Privacy & Security

The extension only captures traffic when actively enabled and only sends data to your configured Akto instance. You have full control over what gets monitored.
