# Agentic Assets

## Overview

The **Agentic Assets** in Akto Atlas provides an inventory of all agentic systems discovered in your environment. Each entry represents a distinct AI-driven system observed in live traffic.

This page is the starting point for navigating into agentic collections and individual components.

## What an Agentic Asset Represents

An **agentic asset** represents a logical agentic system such as an AI agent, MCP server, or LLM endpoint.\
Each asset groups all observed endpoints and execution contexts associated with that system.

### Agentic Assets Summary

The summary section provides a high-level view of discovered agentic systems.

1. Agentic assets: Total number of distinct agentic systems discovered
2. Total endpoints: Total number of endpoints across all agentic assets

### Agentic Assets Table

The table lists all discovered agentic assets.

| Column            | Description                                               |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agentic asset     | Identifier derived from hostname, provider, or agent name |
| Type              | Category of agentic system (AI Agent, MCP Server, LLM)    |
| Endpoints         | Number of endpoints associated with the asset             |
| Risk score        | Aggregated risk score across all associated components    |
| Sensitive data    | Indicates whether sensitive data was detected             |
| Last traffic seen | Time of most recent observed interaction                  |

#### Search and Filtering

* Search: Filters assets by name
* Type filter: Filters assets by agentic system type
{% endhint %}

## Navigating into an Agentic Asset

Selecting an agentic asset opens the **Agentic Asset Details** view.\
The Agentic Asset Details view provides endpoint-level visibility for the selected agentic asset.

### Endpoint List

The endpoint list displays all endpoints through which the agentic asset was observed.

| Column            | Description                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Endpoint ID       | Unique identifier generated by Akto             |
| Username          | Execution identity associated with the endpoint |
| Risk score        | Risk score calculated for the endpoint          |
| Sensitive data    | Indicates sensitive data detection              |
| Last traffic seen | Timestamp of most recent activity               |
| Discovered        | Timestamp of initial discovery                  |

### Endpoint Expansion

Expanding an endpoint row reveals additional execution context associated with the endpoint, such as tool or client identifiers.

This expansion helps distinguish different execution environments using the same agentic asset.

#### Asset-Level Actions

The Agentic Asset Details view includes asset-level controls.

* Explore Mode : Enables interactive exploration of the selected asset
* More Actions : Provides additional asset-level options
  * Export as CSV

## What Next

After reviewing an agentic asset and its endpoints, you can drill down into individual [**agentic components**](../../../agentic-ai-discovery/concepts/endpoints/agent-component.md) exposed by those endpoints.
